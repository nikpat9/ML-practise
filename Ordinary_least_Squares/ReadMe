This is project on scikit linear regression which uses ordinary least squares( minimizing the sum of squares).

The idea is that the model tries to fit a line to the data. Lets condiser the line of the equation y=ax + b.

where the coefficents of a and b are deteremined by the model. Following are the formulaes used to calculate the co efficents a = Σ(x - x_mean)(y - y_mean)/Σ(x- x_mean)^2.

b= y_mean - m * x_mean.

if the data is too spread out then, this isn't effecient.

i have used a data of sale of used cars . out.csv has the data .
i have split data into to sets one for training and one for testing.
